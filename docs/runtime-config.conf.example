# Runtime Configuration Example
# 
# This file demonstrates how to configure server-side settings that will be
# applied before benchmarks run. Configurations are applied to all cluster nodes.
#
# Format: key value (or key=value)
# Comments start with #
# Empty lines are ignored

# IO Threads Configuration
# Controls the number of I/O threads for network operations
io-threads 4
io-threads-do-reads yes

# Worker Threads Configuration  
# Note: This is an engine-specific setting (may vary by Valkey/Redis version)
# search-threads 4

# Memory Configuration
# maxmemory 10gb
# maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# Network Configuration
# tcp-backlog 2048
# tcp-keepalive 300

# Timeout Configuration
# timeout 0

# Logging Configuration
# loglevel notice

# Persistence Configuration (disable for benchmarks)
# save ""
# appendonly no

# Slow Log Configuration
# slowlog-log-slower-than 10000
# slowlog-max-len 128

# Client Configuration
# maxclients 10000

# Example: Performance Tuning for Vector Search
# These settings optimize for vector search workloads:
# - More I/O threads for handling concurrent connections
# - Disable persistence to avoid I/O overhead
# - Increase client limits

# Uncomment to use:
# io-threads 8
# io-threads-do-reads yes
# save ""
# appendonly no
# maxclients 50000
